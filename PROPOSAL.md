# PROPOSAL
## Solar System 3D Simulator
For my final project, I will create a 3D simulation of the solar system. It will essentially be an interactive map of the solar system, showing the sun and the different planets. It can be used as a tool to learn the size proportions of the celestial bodies as well as their movement patterns. 

Each celestial body will be represented with a scaled sphere or icosphere. They will be animated to rotate around their axis as well as around the sun. Users will be able to adjust how long each second is worth (like a year or 10 years) to see the animation go faster or slower. With OpenFrameworks's 3d libraries I can also use a camera to let the user move the frame around to zoom in on different planets.

## Potential External Libraries
OpenFrameworks has many addons for animation such as:
* ofxAnimationKit
* ofxAnimation
* ofxChoreograph
* ofxManipulator
* ofxPhysical

I will also be using OpenFramework's 3D library to create the shapes of the planets.


## Past Experience
I am a part of ACM's SIGGraph, where I've worked with 3d modeling and animation before. While all the 3d modeling I have done previously is through Maya and does not have any coding involved, it should still help make it easier to create the visualization of the solar system. I also have an art background, which should help me create the textures for all my celestial bodies.
