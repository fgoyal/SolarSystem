# DEVELOPMENT

## Library Exploration
I mostly experimented with manipulating different 3d shapes using OpenFramework's 3d library. of3dPrimitives contains the tools to create different shapes like a sphere and icosphere. I was able to manipulate the sizes of the icosphere's, as well as how fast they rotated.

## Week 1
- Created class called CelestialBody to encapsulate all the information about each celestial body. Variables include the name, texture, image, ofSpherePrimitive, radius, orbit, orbit radius, and rotations. The methods currently just have getters and setters.
- Simulation now includes a background and both Earth and Sun

## Week 2
- Created CelestialBody objects including actual data from the solar system
